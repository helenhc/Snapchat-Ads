    "Prediction: We will try to predict the reach, or the number of views, of an ad. This is a regression problem. \n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "TODO\n",
    "\n",
    "### Baseline Model\n",
    "OneHotEncoder is ideal, because we use easily use it on all of the categorical columns. The function of OHE is to \"Encode categorical features as a one-hot numeric array\", so we can have numerical values onto the qualitiative values for easy calculations and predictions within the data. For both numerical and categorical columns, we used Simple Imputer in case there were any missing values that we had missed. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since it is just a baseline model, we did not focus on separating between nominal or ordinal columns because we end up dropping a lot of the columns later in our final model. But we don't differentiate it in our final model either, because we only use either quantitative or nominal data. \n",
    "\n",
    "r-squared: //TODO\n",
    "\n",
    "rmse: //TODO\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the evaluation metric as well as referencing our pipeline, we anticipate the baseline model to not be a very good predictor of the number of views. The OHE wthin the categorical columns is decent, but it does not do anything within the quantitative columns except impute it with a neutral value of 0, which can possibly bias the columns in the direction that we don't want to go in. \n",
    "### Final Model\n",
    "Impressions, Duration, and Spend are our quantitative columns. StartDate, EndDate, Gender, CountryCode, and spending_brackets are our qualitative columns, but more specifically, our nominal data. We are not working with any ordinal data. Although StartDate and EndDate may be a bit blurry on the classification of being nominal or ordinal, we have categorized these two columns as nominal, which is explained in a bit more detail later. We chose to work with these columns specifically because we considered these to contain the most valuable information. StartDate and EndDate might be significant, concerning the exact time of year that the ad was being displayed. For example, if it was aired durig the holiday season, there might be more impressions because more people are out of school, on vacation and not working, etc. As for gender, if there were restrictions on one gender, it cuts off half the general population, which will likely greatly reduce the amount of views an ad has. For CountryCode, there are vastly different population numbers varying by country. The US may have way more impressions than a smaller and less populated country, like Korea for example. It also brings into context that many people around the world may not utilize Snapchat as one of their main sources of social media- in other words, Snapchat may not be as popular in other countries as it is in the United States. As for our newly engineered features and why we believe they are vital to our predictions, they are discussed later within our code. \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the functions that we used within our baseline model, we also included PCA onto our categorical columns as well as QuantileTransformer within our numerical columns. \n",
    "PCA is significant in increasing our accuracy of our predictions because it is able to project the values within the categorical columns into a lower dimensional space if needed by using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). This can be especially important, especially to centralize the values coming from the categorical columns, even if we ourselves may not necessarily see it. As for QuantileTransformer, it allows the numerical columns to follow a bell curved shape. \n",
    "\n",
    "We had set our baseline to a LinearRegression model, but later progressed to using a RandomForestRegressor because we thought that this would work better than a LinearRegression model because it is able to use the averages of our features to be able to produce better predictions. Another plus is that it is able to control, to some extent, over-fitting, which was an issue we were worried about. \n",
